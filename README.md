# About
I started developing a social media app in my spare time for about 2 months or so and ended up with this cool Instagram-Clone!
Basically it allows you to login and upload posts (with images & coordinates), search posts (by names), like and comment on posts.

I learnt a lot about react & backend stuff while doing this including:
- best ways to upgrade a projects packages (which proves to be hard some times)
- write clean client-side & server-side modules
- changing the boilerplate
- optimize bits of code
- much more...

# What I learnt about react
- It's really easy to prototype web-apps quickly, but when it comes to refining them and adding smaller details, the development time starts to slow down. 
- The styling is quite hard, at first, to get right.
- It's got an amazing community that spends a lot of time improving the codebase everyday!
- Changing react versions can prove to be a hard task. Build error, npm package dependcies, and more...

# Usage (run fullstack app on your machine)

## Prerequisites
- [MongoDB](https://gist.github.com/nrollr/9f523ae17ecdbb50311980503409aeb3)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) ^10.0.0
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

notice, you need client and server runs concurrently in different terminal session, in order to make them talk to each other

## Client-side usage(PORT: 3000)
```terminal
$ cd client    // go to client folder
$ npm i       // npm install packages
$ npm start  // run the client side app

```

## Server-side usage(PORT: 5000)

### Prepare your secret

run the script at the first level:

### Start

```terminal
$ npm i       // npm install packages
$ nodemon app // this will run the server side app
```

## Deploy Server to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
```terminal
$ npm i -g heroku
$ heroku login
...
$ heroku create
$ npm run heroku:add <your-super-app>
// remember to run this command in the root level, not the server level, so if you follow the documentation along, you may need to do `cd ..`
$ pwd
/Users/<your-name>/mern
$ npm run deploy:heroku
```
