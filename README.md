# About this project

### Frontend

In the frontend side, we have used React as the frontend library. We have used Redux for state management. We have also used React Bootstrap library for basic designing of the interface.

### Backend

For the backend side, we have used the Express library on top of Nodejs.  MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database to store our data as documents in JSON format. and mongoose to connect to our MongoDB database.

We have created REST APIs with Express and used these endpoints in the React frontend to interact with our backend part.


# Usage (run fullstack app on your machine)

## Prerequisites

### ES Modules in Node

-We have used ECMAScript Modules in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.
-Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error
-You can also install and setup Babel if you would like

### Env Variables

Create a .env file in then root and add the following

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = your mongodb uri
JWT_SECRET = 'abc123'
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = your paypal client id
```

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)

```
npm install
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run

```
# Run frontend (:3000) & backend (:5000)
npm run dev

# Run backend only
npm run server
```

## Build & Deploy

```
# Create frontend prod build
cd frontend
npm run build
```

There is a Heroku postbuild script, so if you push to Heroku, no need to build manually for deployment to Heroku

### Seed Database

You can use the following commands to seed the database with some sample users and products as well as destroy all data

```
# Import data
npm run data:import

# Destroy data
npm run data:destroy
```

```
Sample User Logins
